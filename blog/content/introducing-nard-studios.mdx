# A Code-First Design & Development Studio

This decision has been many years in the making and this service will be focused on building, deploying, and maintaining performant, secure websites.

I intend on handling both design and development aspects but you can bring your own designs or a dedicated designer (if you wish) to speed up the creation process.

## A Spectrum of Sites

Not all websites are built the same.

For example:

<div className="ml-8">
  {" "}
  - A student may want a simple personal site to share resources or showcase a
  project. In most cases, that's a static site — fast to build, fast to ship,
  and may never need an update again. - A business, on the other hand, may
  require something far more dynamic or even realtime: user accounts,
  dashboards, data storage, analytics, notifications, or custom integrations.
  Such a project may take days or weeks and will likely require continuous
  monitoring and improvements throughout its service life.
</div>

In other words: **two websites, two completely different levels of dedication**. Understanding these needs is the first step—long before budget comes into play.

The technicalities usually come next — although most founders don't really care about that. They just want quick, clean, snappy sites for their users. But for those that do care, here's my philosophy of approach:

> Full-code by default — no-code on request.

There are amazing **no-code** tools today, and they absolutely have their place:

<div className="ml-8"> - Webflow - Framer - WordPress</div>

(I am listing these products here simply because I use these from time to time — not sponsored by the way, just tools I trust)

However, I use **full-code** almost exclusively, because I demand total creative control. If a tool won't let me tweak a parameter, refine how something behaves, or optimize performance at the atomic level, then it's not good enough for me, in my opinion. This is where full-code shines.

### <span id="techStack">Tech Stack</span>

**For code-based projects:**

<div className="ml-8">
  - Next.js (my primary framework for both frontend and backend) - Supabase,
  MongoDB, or Firebase for backend/databases - Supporting libraries for UI,
  animations, auth, state management, caching, etc.
</div>

<MediaViewer type="zoomable image" src="/_blog/_imgs/full-code-tools.webp" />

**For no-code projects (when requested or suitable):**

<div className="ml-8">- Webflow - Framer</div>

<MediaViewer type="zoomable image" src="/_blog/_imgs/no-code-tools.webp" />

These no-code tools allow you to build without writing code, though advanced features often require custom scripts. But with flexibility comes cost — features like additional pages, forms, bandwidth, and custom hosting may require you to upgrade to a paid plan.

## Types of websites built

A few examples of the websites included in this service:

<div className="ml-8">
  - Portfolio websites - Personal brands / creators pages - Small business
  websites - Landing pages for products _.etc_
</div>

## Pricing Philosophy

Pricing is guided by:

<div className="ml-8">
  - Complexity (static vs dynamic) - Functionality needed (auth, dashboards,
  forms, APIs, CMS, custom domains, etc.) - Design requirements (custom UI vs
  minimal layout) - Maintenance expectations (one-time vs ongoing)
</div>

This way, you won't pay for things you don't need, and you won't be surprised with hidden costs later.

# Conclusion

It's 2025, and it's easier than ever to create a website. But the hard part — the part that actually matters — is giving it that personal, thoughtful touch.

If you're okay with a site that looks like dozens of others, no-code tools will get you there. But if you want something custom, performant, maintainable, and built with intention, then that's where design services — much like this one — exist to help you ship faster, stay well-maintained, and remove the hassle of trying to juggle site maintenance with running an actual business.

**Whether you're a student, a creator, a small business, or founder — if you have an idea, I'd be happy to help bring it online.**
