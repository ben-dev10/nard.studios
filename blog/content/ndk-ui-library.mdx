## Yet another JS library?

Over the last couple of weeks, I've been working on a new project — a toolkit and UI component library in one. Check it out <Link target="_blank" href={`${GITHUB_LINK}/ndk`} className="_blog-link">
here </Link>.

It bundles a collection of handy tools that I always seem to forget to install when starting a new project, along with pre-styled
shadcn/ui components — modularized. Yes, I bundled shadcn components into an npm package, which is arguably a violation of the <Link target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/academy/shadcn-ui/evolution-of-component-libraries#the-early-days-jquery-plugins-and-manual-dom-manipulation">“black box”</Link>
rule in the shadcn way of building applications. Shadcn has become the foundation of most React-based design system implementations these days, so I
wanted the ability to bring it anywhere I build apps. I also wanted to streamline the manual setup process down to just two steps: install, add a few imports, and that's it.

The main focus, however, is building a UI library ecosystem for web applications:

- Navbars
- Heroes
- Feature Sections
- Footers
- App layouts (shells)
- Templates (_and many more_)

## Conclusion

The project is still in its infancy and is expected to grow rapidly over the coming months. Any feedback, concerns, or feature requests are welcome. Source available on <Link target="_blank" href={`${GITHUB_LINK}/ndk`} className="_blog-link">Github</Link>

Thanks for reading!
