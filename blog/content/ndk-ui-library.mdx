## Yet another JS library?
Over the last couple of weeks, I've been working on a new project - a toolkit and a UI component library in one. Check it out 
<Link href={`${GITHUB_LINK}/ndk`} className="_blog-link">here</Link>.

It bundles up a bunch of nifty tools that I also always forget to install when starting a new project, along with 
pre-styled Shadcn UI components "modularized" - yes I included Shadcn components too, a huge violation to the "black box" rule 
in the Shadcn way of building applications. Shadcn has become the foundation to almost any react-based design system implementation
these days, so I wanted to bring them _anywhere_ I build apps and also to streamline the manual installation of Shadcn - down to just
2 steps: install, add a few imports and thats it.

The main focus here though is to build a UI library ecosystem for web applications:
- Navbars
- Heroes
- Feature Sections
- Footers 
- App layouts (shells)
- Templates (_and many more_)

## Conclusion
The project is still in its infancy and expected to grow rapidly in the coming months; any feedbacks, concerns and requests are welcome.
