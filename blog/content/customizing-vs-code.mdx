Part of what makes VS Code beloved by many is it's extensibility, you can customize pretty much any part of the interface through extensions. 
One way of customization is through the **product and file icons** VS Code uses in it's interface.



# Configuring with custom icons.

Took me a while to figure it out but you can customize the folder icons for Material Icon theme (Published by Philipp Kief, v5.28.0). I followed the instructions outlined in the details tab of the extension page.



Before we begin, make sure you prepare 2 SVG icons for the folder you want to customize, one for the closed state and the other for the opened state. Here is a sample for a folder name `lab`.

SVG Files: 
<div className='flex items-center w-[100px] h-[40px] mb-10'>
  <ImageViewer className="size-12 border-0 !my-0" src="/_blog/posts/customizing-vs-code/svgs/folder-sample-open.svg" />
  <ImageViewer className="size-12 border-0 !my-0" src="/_blog/posts/customizing-vs-code/svgs/folder-sample.svg" />
</div>


You can call them whatever you want, but be sure to attach `-open` before the extension for the opened state SVG. <MediaViewer type="zoomable image" src="/_blog/posts/customizing-vs-code/imgs/svgs.png" />



Next, you have to move the icons to a folder on your system where the extension can reach. For this to work, you have to drop them in a custom folder (I named mine "icons") in the VS Code extensions folder. 
The is usually in your root folder: `<user>/.vscode/extensions/`.

<MediaViewer type="zoomable image" src="/_blog/posts/customizing-vs-code/imgs/icons-folder.png" />



The last thing to do is to update Material Theme Icons' config in the user `settings.json` file. To access this, search for "material" in settings and click on "Edit in settings.json" 
link under "Material Icons > Folders: Associations ",  and add the following snippet (that is if the config object hasn't been populated automatically):

```json title="settings.json"
  "material-icon-theme.folders.associations": {
    "lab": "../../../../icons/folder-sample"
  }
```


<Callout type="info">
  You can get to the user settings quicker by searching "user settings" in the command prompt. 
</Callout>




<MediaViewer type="zoomable image" src="/_blog/posts/customizing-vs-code/imgs/settings.png" />



Now, create a folder with the name `lab` and or new icons will be applied. (You may need to restart VS Code after this).

Final result: 

<MediaViewer type="zoomable image" src="/_blog/posts/customizing-vs-code/imgs/lab.png" />


## Cloning existing icons

If you don't have the time to make custom icons of your own, you can clone existing icons and have them associate with a custom name you choose.
This approach is way more simpler and straightforward. Open your user `settings.json` file and paste the following snippet:

```json title="settings.json"
  "material-icon-theme.folders.customClones": [
    {
      "name": "del",
      "base": "trash",
      "color": "red-500",
      "lightColor": "red-700",
      "folderNames": ["del", "delete", "bin"],
      "rootFolderNames": ["trash"]
    }
  ]
```
For the above example. the new association here is `del` and the icon we are cloning is `trash`. See the folder and Icon names <Link href="#" className="_blog-link">reference.</Link>
